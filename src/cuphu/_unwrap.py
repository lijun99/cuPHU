    deliberate choice. Uses round (not ceil) throughout: ceil-per-axis

    Unwrap an interferogram using GPU-accelerated SNAPHU.

    Performs 2-D phase unwrapping using the Statistical-Cost, Network-Flow
    Algorithm for Phase Unwrapping (SNAPHU) [1]_.  Cost computation, phase
    integration, and connected-component labeling run on the GPU; the
    minimum-cost network-flow solver runs on the CPU (it is inherently
    sequential).

    Parameters
    ----------
    igram : array_like, complex64, 2-D
        Complex interferogram. NaN values are replaced with zeros.
    corr : array_like, float32, 2-D
        Sample coherence magnitude in [0, 1]. Same shape as *igram*.
    nlooks : float
        Equivalent number of independent looks (>= 1).
    cost : {'smooth', 'defo', 'topo'}, optional
        Statistical cost mode. Defaults to ``'smooth'``.
    init : {'mcf', 'mst', 'laplace'}, optional
        Initialization algorithm for the unwrapped phase gradients.
        ``'mcf'``/``'mst'`` run SNAPHU's network-flow solver (CPU,
        exact). ``'laplace'`` instead solves a weighted-least-squares
        relaxation via Jacobi-preconditioned CG (GPU, approximate but
        much faster) -- see *ntiles* for why tiling matters for this mode
        on large scenes. Defaults to ``'mcf'``.
    mask : array_like, bool/uint8, 2-D, optional
        Binary valid-pixel mask. Zero means invalid. Defaults to None.
    mask_buffer : int, optional
        Grow the valid region of *mask* by this many pixels before solving
        (via ``pixels`` rounds of 4-connectivity dilation), then restore
        the original *mask* for the reported ``conncomp`` (padded pixels
        are excluded from the final output; their raw ``unw`` values are
        left as solved, same as any other masked pixel in this API).
        Defaults to 64 -- an unbuffered mask boundary can strand a narrow
        valid feature on the wrong whole-cycle branch, for both mcf/mst
        and laplace. Pass 0 to disable.

        For ``init='laplace'``: fixes a real failure mode, not just a
        cosmetic one. Narrow or isolated valid features right at a mask
        boundary (e.g. a thin coastal spit next to open water) can become
        tiny, weakly-connected components once masked, where the PCG solve
        and/or bridging has almost nothing reliable to anchor them to --
        confirmed on real data drifting over 100 cycles from the true
        value. Padding the mask before solving gives these features a real
        connection to the rest of the valid region to solve through;
        validated on a real coastal scene reducing the near-boundary
        mismatch (vs. an independent MCF reference) from std=27 rad to
        std=0.7 rad. A starting value of ~64px is reasonable; scale up for
        scenes with wider decorrelated/invalid buffers at valid-region
        edges. Defaults to 0 (no padding, matches prior behavior).

        Also passed internally as ``orig_mask`` (see the C extension's
        ``cuphu_unwrap()`` docstring) so tile-stitching only trusts
        genuinely real boundary data, not the padded-through fiction --
        without this, a tile whose own solve got corrupted through a thin
        padded connection could silently propagate that corruption into
        its entire whole-tile stitching offset, and downstream to every
        tile chained to it. Confirmed on real data: fixed a whole
        tile-column of a real coastal scene that was off from an
        independent MCF reference by several rad on average (isolated
        pixels within it off by 10+ rad), down to matching MCF closely.
    mag : array_like, float32, 2-D, optional
        Interferogram magnitude. Derived from *igram* if None.
    min_conncomp_frac : float, optional
        Minimum connected component size as a fraction of total pixels.
    phase_grad_window : (int, int), optional
        Size of the sliding window for averaging wrapped phase gradients
        in the (perpendicular, parallel) directions.
    ntiles : (int, int) or None, optional
        Number of tiles in (row, column) directions. If None (default):
        for ``init='laplace'``, defaults to an automatically computed
        tiling that keeps each tile's edge length near *target_tile_size*
        (see below) -- a single huge tile leaves the Jacobi-preconditioned
        CG solve unable to converge on large scenes (its iteration count
        scales with tile edge length), which can silently produce
        whole-cycle errors over large, otherwise well-correlated regions.
        For ``init='mcf'``/``'mst'``, defaults to a single tile ``(1, 1)``
        when *nproc* is 1; when *nproc* > 1, auto-tiles the same way as
        laplace (toward *target_tile_size*, not toward a tile count) --
        TreeSolve has no laplace-style correctness reason to tile, so this
        only happens to give the parallel tile solve something to
        distribute across threads. Pass an explicit value to override any
        default, including ``(1, 1)`` to force single-tile Laplace (fine,
        even faster, for scenes already smaller than *target_tile_size*) or
        single-tile MCF/MST regardless of *nproc*.
    tile_overlap : int or (int, int) or None, optional
        Pixel overlap between adjacent tiles, used to register tiles
        against each other (median offset over the shared region). If
        None (default): 64 for every init method -- explicitly pass 0
        only alongside a single-tile ``ntiles=(1, 1)``, where there are no
        tile boundaries to register.
    target_tile_size : int, optional
        Target tile edge length in pixels, including overlap, used to
        auto-compute *ntiles* when *ntiles* is None, for ``init='laplace'``
        always and for ``init='mcf'``/``'mst'`` when *nproc* > 1.
        Empirically, edge lengths of roughly 1000-2000px converge reliably
        within the laplace solver's internal iteration cap without either
        stalling (too large: >~4000px measurably degrades convergence,
        ~8800px can leave whole regions a full cycle wrong) or losing
        registration accuracy (too small: <~700px starts raising
        cycle-disagreement again, from a single tile more often being
        dominated by one bad local feature and from longer inter-tile
        stitching chains). 1024 is a reasonable default across that range;
        tune down for scenes with large decorrelated features, or up for
        speed if a scene is known to be uniformly well-correlated. For
        mcf/mst this same default is a reasonable, but not similarly
        measured, throughput heuristic -- TreeSolve has no convergence
        dependence on tile size.
    nproc : int, optional
        Maximum number of CPU threads for parallel tile network-flow solves
        (``init='mcf'``/``'mst'`` only). If < 1, uses all available cores.
        Also gates whether mcf/mst's own *ntiles* auto-tiling above runs at
        all when *ntiles* is None -- set explicitly to 1 to keep
        single-tile mcf/mst regardless of core count.
    tile_cost_thresh : int, optional
        Cost threshold for determining reliable tile regions.
    min_region_size : int, optional
        Minimum number of pixels in a reliable tile region.
    single_tile_reoptimize : bool, optional
        After tiled unwrapping and stitching, rerun a full CPU network-flow
        solve (SNAPHU's exact TreeSolve, not the GPU-accelerated path) over
        the entire assembled scene as a single tile, seeded from the
        stitched result, to clean up tile-boundary artifacts. Has no effect
        when the effective tiling is ``(1, 1)`` -- including mcf/mst's own
        ``nproc``-driven auto-tiling above, worth turning on together with
        ``nproc`` > 1 if you want tiled-for-parallelism mcf/mst without its
        tile-boundary stitching caveats.

        cuPHU's own tile stitching (median 2π offset per tile pair,
        propagated via a spanning tree over tile adjacency) is
        coarser than SNAPHU's own per-region secondary-network stitching:
        it applies one constant offset per whole tile (can't correct a
        real discontinuity crossing through the middle of a tile), and has
        no loop-closure correction when the tile grid has cycles (any
        ``ntilerow >= 2 and ntilecol >= 2`` layout). This option is the
        cleanup pass for those cases -- directly analogous to SNAPHU's own
        ``SINGLETILEREOPTIMIZE`` / ``snaphu-py``'s identically-named
        ``single_tile_reoptimize`` parameter. It also merges connected-
        component labels across tile boundaries as a side effect (today,
        without it, the same physical region spanning multiple tiles gets
        distinct label ranges per tile).

        Defaults to ``False``, deliberately diverging from ``snaphu-py``'s
        default of ``True``: this is a full-scene CPU network-flow solve
        that can dominate total wall time on large scenes (the same
        mechanism that made ``snaphu-py``'s reopt pass run for hours on a
        large NISAR scene when left at its default). Enable it for final/
        delivery-quality runs, or when tile-boundary artifacts are visibly
        present; leave it off for speed-sensitive runs. Supersedes
        *laplace_neighbor_feedback*, which is a no-op when this is True.
    laplace_neighbor_feedback : bool, optional
        ``init='laplace'`` only. Refines each internal tile boundary with a
        smoothly-varying (per-row for column boundaries, per-column for row
        boundaries) residual correction on top of the whole-tile bulk
        offset, feathered into the tile interior over
        *laplace_neighbor_feedback_feather* px.

        Targets a failure mode ``single_tile_reoptimize``'s whole-tile
        constant offset can't reach: independently-solved Laplace PCG
        tiles can show a genuinely position-varying mismatch along their
        shared boundary (confirmed on real data: a clean, low-noise ~9 rad
        step localized to specific rows, not present at neighboring rows --
        not explainable by a whole-tile rounding/registration error).
        Cheaper than ``single_tile_reoptimize`` (no full-scene CPU re-solve),
        but a partial fix: on the real boundary this was validated against,
        it reduced the typical row-level mismatch by 5-20%, with the
        remaining residual dominated by genuine per-pixel noise that no
        offset-based correction can remove. Off by default. No effect for
        ``init='mcf'``/``'mst'`` (their whole-tile offset is already exact),
        when the effective tiling is ``(1, 1)``, or when
        *single_tile_reoptimize* is True (which supersedes it).
    laplace_neighbor_feedback_feather : int, optional
        Pixels over which the boundary correction above decays to zero
        moving away from the boundary. Only used when
        *laplace_neighbor_feedback* is True.
    fix_cycle_spikes : bool, optional
        Detect and correct isolated single row/column whole-2\ :math:`\pi`
        -cycle spikes: a row (or column) whose median offset from both
        immediate neighbors is the same nonzero integer multiple of
        2\ :math:`\pi`, while those neighbors agree with each other -- the
        signature of a degenerate network-flow (``init='mcf'``/``'mst'``,
        or ``single_tile_reoptimize``) solution with a spurious,
        self-cancelling flow loop through one row/column. Confirmed on a
        real 240M-pixel scene: 17 isolated rows out of 18240, no local
        coherence anomaly at any of them. Off by default.
    bridge : bool, optional
        Reconcile whole-2\ :math:`\pi`-cycle offsets between disconnected
        regions of unwrapped phase (e.g. regions split apart by *mask*) --
        a native GPU/C++ port of isce3's ``bridge_unwrapped_phase()``
        (``isce3.unwrap.bridge_phase``). Labels disconnected regions of
        ``unw != 0`` (8-connectivity), drops small/thin ones
        (*bridge_min_num_pixel*, erosion-based pruning at
        *bridge_erosion_size*), builds a minimum-spanning tree over
        nearest-boundary-point region distances, and applies a per-region
        whole-cycle correction (via AOI-median comparison at
        *bridge_radius*) walking the tree from the largest region outward.
        Defaults to ``False``. v1 has no ramp/deramp support (isce3's
        ``ramp_type``) -- NISAR's own production default is already
        ``ramp_type=None``, so this covers the mode actually used in
        production today. Parameter names/defaults mirror NISAR's
        production ``bridge_*`` runconfig keys for easy migration.
    bridge_radius : int, optional
        AOI half-size (px) for the per-bridge median phase comparison.
        Only used when *bridge* is True.
    bridge_min_num_pixel : int, optional
        Regions smaller than this are dropped before bridging. Only used
        when *bridge* is True.
    bridge_erosion_size : int, optional
        Structuring-element size (px) for erosion-based thin/small-region
        pruning (two-stage: square, then circular). Only used when
        *bridge* is True.
    bridge_max_boundary_samples : int, optional
        Cap on boundary points sampled per region for the nearest-neighbor
        region-pair search, bounding cost regardless of any single
        region's true perimeter. Only used when *bridge* is True.
    bridge_ramp_type : str or None, optional
        Ramp to fit over the reference region and remove before bridging,
        add back after: one of 'linear', 'quadratic', 'linear_range',
        'linear_azimuth', 'quadratic_range', 'quadratic_azimuth', or None
        (no ramp, default). Matches isce3's bridge_phase.py deramp().
    bridge_ramp_max_num_sample : int, optional
        Uniform grid-stride subsample cap for the ramp fit. Default 1e6.
    reference_pixel : (int, int) or None, optional
        (row, col) to shift the whole output by an integer number of 2*pi
        cycles so that pixel matches its own raw wrapped phase exactly.
        Unwrapped phase is only ever defined up to an arbitrary additive
        constant; SNAPHU's MCF/MST always anchors to (0, 0) (see
        ``phi[0][0] = psi[0][0]`` in ``ext/snaphu/src/snaphu_util.c``),
        while ``'laplace'``'s reference emerges from a global relaxation
        and generally lands elsewhere. Defaults to ``(0, 0)``, matching
        MCF/MST's own convention (a no-op for those methods, since they
        already satisfy it by construction); pass None to disable.
    gpu_id : int, optional
        CUDA device index. Defaults to 0.
    unw : array_like or None, optional
        Pre-allocated output array for the unwrapped phase (float32).
    conncomp : array_like or None, optional
        Pre-allocated output array for connected-component labels (uint32).

    Returns
    -------
    unw : ndarray, float32
        Unwrapped phase in radians.
    conncomp : ndarray, uint32
        Connected-component labels (0 = unassigned).
